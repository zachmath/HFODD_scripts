These scripts take an HFODD stdout file and use it to [approximately] construct 1D cuts of the potential energyy surface. I say approximately because the curve suggested by these plots may not be continuous on the actual PES.

These scripts need to be consolidated and upgraded. Right now they kind of get the job done but there's a lot of room for improvement.
